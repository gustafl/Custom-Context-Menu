# Custom Context Menu

This repo contains a context menu built in JavaScript, built Nick Salloum's excellent article titled [Building a Custom Right-Click (Context) Menu with JavaScript](https://www.sitepoint.com/building-custom-right-click-context-menu-javascript/). Not only has Nick created a beautiful and yet minimal example - in the article, he deals with _all_ of the problems you're likely to come accross when developing a context menu in JavaScript. I learned a lot.

Even though this is a fork of Nick's repo, it's not a fork in the usual sense. I have not used the files in the original repo. All the files in this repo came about as I read Nick's article.

Nick has a demo of his context menu [here](http://codepen.io/callmenick/pen/xbaWdB).
